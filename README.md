## Description
In this project, we were trying to find the link between Google searches on the most notorious French luxury brands and the stock marlet listing price of the related luxury groups.
The scope of our analysis:
- Time interval : 2020
- Luxury groups : LVMH, Kering and Hermes
- Luxury brands : Louis Vuitton, Dior, Gucci, Bottega Veneta and Hermes
- Geographical scope for the Google trends data : world wide

## Dataset 
We use multiple datasets but only 2 types :
- csv. files for the stock market listing price (Source : [abcbourse.com](https://www.abcbourse.com/marches/))
- API from Google : pytrends (documentation [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/google-trends-api-for-python-a84bc25db88f))
